To test:
Compile using 'make screen.x'.
Run './screen.x [int] [int]' by entering two integers for the size.
Enter 'make clean' to clean the directory.

This build has the fully functioning game.


Extra:
The head of the snake has different symbol for each direction.

The snake gets fatter as you increase your score.

The vertical movement is calibrated to be close to the same speed
as the horizontal movement.

(Old Version)
To test: 
Compile using 'make test.x' for the test program.
Run './test.x [int] [int]' by entering two integers after.
Enter 'make clean' to clean the directory.

In this test program builds will create the worm.  In the worm class the 
grid is built and in the Grid class builds the FreePool which are linked 
together. 
As long as the second number entered is larger than 2 the worm(-1) will move 
down the length of the grid with each movement printing a new grid and worm 
representation.


Issues:
With certain integers such as './test.x 8 8' it will work, while other integers
such as './test.x 10 10' will NOT work giving me this error:

'*** Error in `./test.x': double free or corruption (out): 0x000000000181a420 ***'

It seems to be that something isn't initialized correctly somewhere in the creation
of the grid(grid.cpp)

Some of the other integers such as './test.x 9 9' will work, but the corners are
filled with random numbers rather than '-1'.
